# stagehand

**[dtch1997.github.io/stagehand](https://dtch1997.github.io/stagehand/)** · a one-page tour.

A tiny **declarative engine for orchestrating steps at scale** — with live monitoring.

You declare *what* work needs doing and how the pieces depend on each other; the engine
figures out *how* to run it: scheduling everything that's ready up to a concurrency cap,
streaming results from one step into the next without barriers, fanning out dynamically,
retrying with feedback, and stopping early when you've got enough. Every step writes a
small file as it runs, so the whole thing renders as one live web page.

A "step" is just an async function — so the same engine drives an experiment sweep, a
fleet of coding agents, a data pipeline, or an eval harness. The core is pure stdlib
(zero runtime deps).

| Layer | What it gives you |
|-------|-------------------|
| `monitor`   | a file-backed `running/done/failed` + `done/total` ticker per unit of work; units link via `parent` into a tree |
| `dashboard` | render that tree into one auto-refreshing HTML status page |
| `engine`    | the **DAG engine**: declare with `Flow.map`/`filter`/`reduce`/`expand`/`add` (+ `best_of`/`with_retry` policies), `await flow.run(stop_when=…)`; streams between steps, fans out, exits early |
| `dsl`       | an **imperative-reading surface**: `with flow(…)` + `do`/`fanout`/`retry` — lazy handles that read like straight-line code and compile to the DAG |
| `agents`    | **coding agents as steps**: `agent(prompt, …)` → `AgentOutcome`, behind a backend seam (zero-dep `subprocess_backend`, or the recommended lazy `flightdeck_backend()`) |
| `pipeline`  | `live_dashboard` (serve the live graph) + `headless_handoff` (hand a finished run to a non-interactive `claude -p`) |
| `serve`     | put `status.html` behind a Cloudflare quick tunnel for a public live link (needs the `cloudflared` binary) |

```bash
make setup     # uv sync
make test      # unit tests
make example   # run the worked sweep (fake compute) -> runs/status.html
```

## The model

A **step** is an async function. A **node** declares a step over some inputs and returns
a **handle** — a typed placeholder for that step's output(s). You wire dependencies by
passing handles as inputs; the engine infers the edges and runs each step the moment its
inputs are ready. There are **no barriers** except where a step genuinely needs a whole
upstream collection — that's `reduce`. A step that raises is captured (its dependents
skip) without aborting the run.

```python
from stagehand import Flow, live_dashboard

flow = Flow("runs", concurrency=8)
trained = flow.map("train", configs, train_one)        # one task per config
healthy = flow.filter("gate", trained, is_healthy)     # survivors stream on
evals   = flow.map("eval", healthy, eval_one)          # eval_i waits on train_i only
best    = flow.reduce("pick", evals, choose_best)      # the *only* barrier

async with live_dashboard(flow.runs_dir, title="my run") as status_html:
    state = await flow.run(stop_when=lambda s: s.done >= 100)   # early-exit optional
winner = best.result
```

**Nodes** (each returns a handle; pass a handle as a source to wire the edge):
- `flow.map(node, source, fn)` — one task per item of `source` (a static iterable **or** an upstream handle), each running `async fn(item)`; results stream out. `concurrency=` caps the node.
- `flow.filter(node, source, pred)` — `pred(item) -> bool | (ok, issues)`; only survivors propagate, pruned items go red and their dependents skip.
- `flow.reduce(node, source, fn)` — the **barrier**: `fn(list_of_results)` once all upstream tasks are terminal, over the survivors.
- `flow.expand(node, source, fn)` — **dynamic fan-out**: `fn(result) -> iterable`, each element becomes a task (when the width isn't known until runtime).
- `flow.add(id, fn, deps=[…])` — raw escape hatch for irregular graphs.
- `await flow.run(stop_when=None, check=False)` — schedule the graph, bounded by `concurrency`; returns the final `RunState` (`.results`, `.done`, `.failed`, `.skipped`).

### Policies: fan-out and retry

`best_of` and `with_retry` wrap a step into a richer step — drop them into `map`:

```python
from stagehand import best_of, with_retry

winners = flow.map("solve", units, best_of(solve, n=4, score=lambda r: r["reward"]))
fixed   = flow.map("fix",   units, with_retry(solve, check=parses, max_attempts=3))
```

- `best_of(fn, n, judge=… | score=…)` — run `n` attempts, keep the best (async-or-sync `judge(results) -> index`, or objective `score`). Raisers dropped; losers marked red.
- `with_retry(fn, check=…, max_attempts=3, feedback=None)` — re-run an item that flunks `check(result) -> (ok, issues)` or raises, feeding the prior feedback back in.

Each attempt is `fn(item, attempt=i, feedback=fb)` — your fn opts in by accepting those
keywords (a plain `fn(item)` still works). They nest: `best_of(with_retry(fn, …), n=4, …)`.

## Straight-line code: the DSL

The per-task surface — `do(fn, …)` is one task and reads imperatively. It's *lazy*:
`do` returns a placeholder handle, nothing runs until `run()`, and deps are inferred from
the handles you pass.

```python
from stagehand import flow, do, fanout, retry, run

with flow("runs", concurrency=8):
    ckpt  = do(train, cfg)                      # a task, no deps
    good  = do(check, ckpt)                     # handle arg ⇒ dependency
    best  = fanout(solve, good, n=4, score=s)   # same shape as do
    fixed = retry(format, best, check=parses)   # same shape as do
    do(report, after=[fixed])                   # `wait(A); do(B)` — ordering-only dep
    await run(stop_when=lambda s: s.done >= 100)
print(ckpt.result)                              # filled in after the run
```

- `do(fn, *args, after=…)` — one task; handles in args become deps (a **list** of handles reduces over the survivors), `after=[…]` is an ordering-only dep.
- `fanout` / `retry` — the same shape as `do`, wrapping the policies into a node.
- `each(fn, items)` — `[do(fn, x) for x in items]`.

Because a handle is a placeholder you **can't `if` on its value while building** — do
result-dependent control flow *inside* a step (a normal coroutine: plain `await`/`if`;
raise to prune), or with `filter` / `expand`.

## Types: compile the graph

Steps declare their I/O with plain hints. `flow.check()` reads them and verifies the graph
can run start to end — every dependency exists, no cycles, and each edge's producer type
fits the consumer — *before* you spend any compute.

```python
async def train(cfg: Config) -> Model: ...
async def evaluate(m: Model) -> Eval: ...

flow.check()                 # raises FlowCheckError on a malformed/ill-typed graph
await flow.run(check=True)   # check first, then run
```

```
flow check failed:
  - map 'eval' <- 'train': expects str, got Model
```

`Handle[T]` is generic, so `.result` / `.results()` are typed in your editor. It's
**gradual and pragmatic** — unannotated == `Any`, subclasses / `list[T]` / `Optional` are
handled, anything it can't reason about passes. A linter, not a type system.

## Coding agents as steps

An agent is just a step. `agent(prompt, …)` spawns a headless coding agent and returns a
structured `AgentOutcome` — so it composes with everything: `fanout` for best-of-N agents,
`retry` for retry-with-feedback, `reduce` to merge.

```python
from stagehand import flow, fanout, run, agent, flightdeck_backend, set_default_backend

set_default_backend(flightdeck_backend())        # live monitoring (optional; see below)

with flow("runs", concurrency=4):
    patch = agent("fix the failing test in foo.py", isolation="worktree")
    best  = fanout(solve_agent, "implement #42", n=4, judge=pick_best_patch)  # best-of-N
    await run()
print(patch.result.diff)
```

- `agent(prompt, *inputs, isolation=None, backend=None, tools=…, model=…)` — `prompt` is a string or a callable built from upstream (`agent(lambda issue: f"fix {issue}", issue_h)`). Returns `Handle[AgentOutcome]` (`{ok, summary, diff, cost, tokens, session_id, raw}`).
- `isolation="worktree"` — run the agent in its own throwaway git worktree and capture the diff. Use it whenever agents run in parallel and edit files.
- **Backends** (the seam — the core stays dependency-free):
  - `subprocess_backend` (default) — zero-dep `claude -p --output-format json`.
  - `flightdeck_backend()` (recommended) — runs each agent as a [flightdeck](https://github.com/dtch1997/flightdeck) `AgentRun` with live stream-json capture to the dashboard (status / action / tokens / cost / resume). `flightdeck` is imported lazily — an optional integration, not a dependency.

Any step can stream its own live progress to the dashboard with `current_monitor().set(…)`.

## Serving the dashboard

`live_dashboard` writes `status.html`; `serve` puts it behind a Cloudflare quick tunnel:

```python
from stagehand import serve
async with live_dashboard("runs", title="my run"):
    url, stop = serve("runs")     # -> https://<random>.trycloudflare.com/status.html
    try:
        await flow.run()
    finally:
        stop()
```

The only requirement is the **`cloudflared`** binary on PATH — touched only when you call
`serve()`, so the core stays dependency-free.

## The monitor primitive

Underneath it all, any unit of work can watch itself — a file-backed `running/done/failed`
+ `done/total` ticker (the engine uses one per task, but it's usable on its own):

```python
from stagehand import monitor
with monitor("cell_s0", total=256, path="runs/cell_s0/train.progress.json",
             parent="sweep") as m:
    for batch in batches:
        m.update(loss=train_step(batch))     # advance + record fields (throttled writes)
```

On clean exit the state goes `done`; on exception `failed` (error captured) and re-raises.
`mark(path, …)` patches a unit post-hoc; `read_monitors(root)` loads the whole tree;
`monitor(…, cleanup=True)` is ephemeral.

## Examples

Runnable with faked compute, so they go anywhere in a couple of seconds:
- [`examples/sweep.py`](examples/sweep.py) — the engine form (`map`/`filter`/`reduce`).
- [`examples/dsl_demo.py`](examples/dsl_demo.py) — the same sweep in `do`/`fanout`/`retry`.
- [`examples/fanout_retry.py`](examples/fanout_retry.py) — policies + dynamic `expand`.
- [`examples/agent_fleet.py`](examples/agent_fleet.py) — coding agents as a fleet of steps.
