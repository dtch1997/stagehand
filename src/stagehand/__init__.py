"""stagehand — primitives + a declarative engine for orchestrating and monitoring
experiment runs.

  monitor   — a file-backed `running/done/failed` + `done/total` primitive per unit
              of work; units link via `parent` into a tree.
  dashboard — render the run as one auto-refreshing HTML status page: a generic
              table of every unit (state/progress/note/error), plus a mermaid DAG
              of the nodes when a `graph.json` topology is present. Renders
              whatever monitor files exist — no assumptions about the work's shape.
  engine    — the DAG executor: declare work with `Flow.map`/`filter`/`reduce`/
              `expand`/`add` (+ `best_of` / `with_retry` node policies) and
              `await flow.run(stop_when=...)`. The scheduler streams results between
              nodes (no barriers except `reduce`), fans out dynamically, and exits
              early on a criterion.
  agents    — coding-agent instances as steps: `agent(flow, prompt, …)` ->
              AgentOutcome, behind a backend seam (zero-dep `subprocess_backend`,
              or the recommended lazy `flightdeck_backend()`); composes with
              best_of/with_retry.
  checks    — reusable correctness predicates (`produced`/`finite`/`exit_ok`/
              `tests_pass`/`valid_image`/…) returning a composable `(ok, issues)`
              gate result; the per-step-type recipes in `cookbook/` build on them.
  live      — `live_dashboard`: poll a running flow's monitor tree and re-render
              one auto-refreshing HTML status page until you're done.
  artifacts — content-addressed inputs/outputs with lineage: `ArtifactStore`
              persists files/dirs/secrets by content hash (records `inputs` +
              `produced_by`), behind a backend seam (zero-dep `local_backend`, or
              the default lazy `cloudfs_backend()`).
  serve     — put status.html behind a public tunnel; a thin lazy re-export of the
              standalone `marquee` library (providers: cloudflared / localhost.run /
              ngrok), imported only when called so the core stays dependency-free.
  manifest  — automatic provenance: `Flow.run()` writes `runs_dir/manifest.json`
              (git sha/dirty/branch, argv, cwd, python, host, optional config) and
              `ArtifactStore.put()` stamps `meta["git"]` on every produced artifact,
              so results always answer "which code produced this?".
  memo      — content-keyed step memoization: `Flow(memo=…)` persists every
              successful result keyed on fn source + inputs, so re-running an
              identical flow is free (crashed sweeps resume), changed steps re-run,
              and `run(refresh=True)` is the explicit "new samples" act.
